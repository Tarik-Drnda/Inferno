  initialDialog:
  - Welcome to the depths of Hell, traveler. I am Minos, the guardian of these infernal
    realms and the arbiter of the circles of Hell. It appears that you have wandered
    into this dark domain by chance, have you not?
  - But fret not, for every soul has its own path to traverse. Despite the accidental
    nature of your arrival, I shall grant you passage to continue onward. You are
    permitted to face the trials that lie ahead, to strive for your eventual return
    to the realm of the living.
  - Take your step bravely, traveler, and begin your journey through this dark crossroad
    of destinies. Perhaps you will find your way back, perhaps you will find redemption.
    Only forge ahead bravely, for only the brave can emerge from these fires unchanged.
  - Be warned, however, that the path ahead is fraught with peril. Many obstacles
    await you, and the challenges you will encounter are not to be taken lightly.
    You must steel yourself for the trials ahead, for they will test your courage
    and resolve to their limits
  - Yet, take heart, brave traveler. Though the road may be treacherous, it is not
    impassable. With determination and perseverance, you may yet find your way through
    this labyrinth of suffering. Face each challenge with resolve, for it is through
    adversity that one's true strength is revealed.
  - Go forth now, into the shadows that shroud this realm. May you emerge from the
    fires of Hell unscathed, your spirit unbroken by the trials that await. Remember,
    it is the courageous who emerge triumphant from the depths of despair.
